## Introduction 
Thorugh out my time in Summer Studio 02 Cyber Security: An Offensive Mindset, I have gone from very basic introductory level knowledge of Cyber Security, to being able to attempt Hack-the-Box challenges with confidence in my skills.
The studio has really help me develop the nessacary skills for the industry and develop the mindset needed to address these new challenges. 
In this post, I will be discussing how ive addressed each Subject Learning Outcome over the course of the studio as well as provide evidence based on each SLO.
