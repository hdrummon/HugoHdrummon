## Introduction 
Throughout my time in Summer Studio 02 Cyber Security: An Offensive Mindset, I have gone from very basic introductory level knowledge of Cyber Security, to being able to attempt Hack-the-Box challenges with confidence in my skills.
The studio has really help me develop the necessary skills for the industry and develop the mindset needed to address these new challenges. 
In this post, I will be discussing how I’ve addressed each Subject Learning Outcome over the course of the studio as well as provide evidence based on each SLO.
I’d like personally like the thank our studios tutors, Larry, Jason and Max for providing the insight and guidance along the journey through this studio, and providing the opportunity to learn such an interesting topic.

## SLO1 Engage with stakeholders to identify a problem or scope a defined problem
Across each week, I found my problem statement switching between different problems that I found in the industry. Each week as I interacted with stakeholders I found that my initial problem statement when asked as a question would often be solved or at least recognised by the stakeholder.
In some weeks however I found that there was no problem statement that came to mind, such as in Week1 and Week4 I didn’t interact with any stakeholders because I wasn’t aware that I could use our tutors as stakeholders, nor did I have any problem in Week4 at the time since Week1 I was away.
That being said, every other week I managed to interact with different stakeholders, and rather the come up with one major problem statement I had several minor statements. 
Some of these stakeholders include:
<ul>
<li>
Patrick Kelso From UTS Security (Week 2)
</li>
<li>
Robert Mitchell Formerly from Pure Security (Week 2)
</li>
<li>
Pieter Westein From Deloite (Week 5)
</li>
<li>
Nathan Jones From Deloitte (Week 5)
</li>
<li>
Larry and Jason (Week 2-6)
</li>
</ul>


## SLO2 Apply design and systems thinking to respond to a defined or newly identified problem
During the first couple of weeks of the Summer Studio, I really lacked a sense of direction regarding how to utilise a design thinking approach towards work, more so towards any Cyber Security related problems. Due to how difficult it originally was, I didn’t necessarily adopt a design thinking approach initial since I had no proper understanding of what to do.
But towards the end of the studio when I started to use more difficult boxes and use my knowledge from practicing previous CTF machines. I managed to use a particular design thinking approach to understand how to handle this problem and what was expected. 
Once I started attempting CTF challenges like **Basic Pentesting**, **Literally Vulnerable** and the newer Hack-the-Box Machines **OpenAdmin** and **Traverxec** I was able to properly adopt a design thinking approach to each stage of the machine.
I follows a very similar process the three major E's, Enumerate, Exploit and Escalate. By using these "major E's" I was better able to utilise a design thinking methodology approach when attempting a box.
For example, if I were to attempt a box I would go through mostly the Define through to Testing.
<ol>
<li>
Define (The problem): Navigate through the machine to get Root.
</li>
<li>
Ideate (Create many ideas through brainstorming): Enumerate a systems files to find a possible lead.
</li>
<li>
Prototype (Hands-on approach): Finding an potential exploit.
</li>
<li>
Test (Testing solutions): Using a version exploit of Escalate user.
</li>
</ol>
This particular approach would repeat until the desired goal is meet.
Since I wouldn’t always find the correct exploit every time, I would have to repeat the Ideate process to determine a better solution.
## SLO3 Apply technical skills to develop, model and/or evaluate designs
From the beginning of the studio I was already struggling with technical areas of Cyber Security, primarily skills used in CTF and Wargame challenges which I had some practice in but not enough to be confident in.
But over the six weeks, the studio has forced me to evolve and adapt my knowledge toward tools and concepts. Each week I learned a new concept that helped me on my Journey through the studio
<ul>
<li>
**Week 1** 
- GitHub and GitBash: Setting up this Hugo blog and website.
</li>
<li>
**Week 2** 
- NetworkMapper(NMAP)/Zenmap and Linux CLI: Used a lot of Linux CLI in OverTheWire / PicoCTP challenges and NMAP for presentation. 
</li>
<li>
**Week 3** 
- Linux CLI, GIT, SQL Injection and Web Application attacks: Used a mixture of Linux CLI and Web Application attacks for OverTheWire-Natas challenges. SQL Injections was primarily used for our presentation but also used on OWASP Juice Shop (Demonstration can be found **<a href="https://www.hdrummon.me/post/reflection3/">**here.</a> ).
</li>
<li>
**Week 4**
 - WPScan, Dirb, Privilege Escalation, Netdiscover, Burp Suite, NetCat, Sudo Reverse Shell, Metasploit, John: All of these were used when attempting **<a href="https://www.hdrummon.me/post/write-ups/basic-penetration-testing-1-write-up/">**Basic Pentesting.</a>, **<a href="https://www.hdrummon.me/post/write-ups/me-and-my-girlfriend-write-up-1/">**Me and My Girlfriend 1</a> and **<a href="https://www.hdrummon.me/post/write-ups/literally-vulnerable/">**Literally Vulnerale.</a>   
</li>
<li>
Week 5
</li>
</ul>

## SLO4 Demonstrate effective collaboration and communication skills


## SLO5 Conduct critical self, peer, and group review and performance evaluation
