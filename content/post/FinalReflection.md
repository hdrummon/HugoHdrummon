## Introduction 
Throughout my time in Summer Studio 02 Cyber Security: An Offensive Mindset, I have gone from very basic introductory level knowledge of Cyber Security, to being able to attempt Hack-the-Box challenges with confidence in my skills.
The studio has really help me develop the necessary skills for the industry and develop the mindset needed to address these new challenges. 
In this post, I will be discussing how I’ve addressed each Subject Learning Outcome over the course of the studio as well as provide evidence based on each SLO.
I’d like personally like the thank our studios tutors, Larry, Jason and Max for providing the insight and guidance along the journey through this studio, and providing the opportunity to learn such an interesting topic.

## SLO1 Engage with stakeholders to identify a problem or scope a defined problem
Across each week, I found my problem statement switching between different problems that I found in the industry. Each week as I interacted with stakeholders I found that my initial problem statement when asked as a question would often be solved or at least recognised by the stakeholder.
In some weeks however I found that there was no problem statement that came to mind, such as in Week1 and Week4 I didn’t interact with any stakeholders because I wasn’t aware that I could use our tutors as stakeholders, nor did I have any problem in Week4 at the time since Week1 I was away.
That being said, every other week I managed to interact with different stakeholders, and rather the come up with one major problem statement I had several minor statements. 
Some of these stakeholders include:
<ul>
<li>
**Patrick Kelso From UTS Security** (Week 2)
</li>
<li>
**Robert Mitchell Formerly from Pure Security** (Week 2)
</li>
<li>
**Pieter Westein From Deloite** (Week 5)
</li>
<li>
**Nathan Jones From Deloitte** (Week 5)
</li>
<li>
**Larry and Jason** (Week 2-6)
</li>
</ul>
During the weeks as I spoke with the major stakeholders, I would often have different questions prepared for every time I knew I would interact with any stake holders.
Such as in week 2 when I interacted with Patrick Kelso and Robert Mitchell I had question lined up such as *"Is there a point were processing power hits a threshold that cyber security tools wont handle"* and *"Is it necessarily required to have 3 Years of industry experience for a entry level job"*.
I also asked similar question to Pieter Westein and Nathan Jones "How do they deal with the human element in threat assessment in penetration testing and what measures would be taken to prevent this". They answered each of these questioned as I mentioned in my **<a href="https://www.hdrummon.me/post/reflection2/">**Week 2.</a> and **<a href="https://www.hdrummon.me/post/reflection5/">**Week 5.</a>
<br>
<br>
My overall problem statement encompasses the human element in the industry, both external and internal to the field. Since this area an overall important field that I want to understand and address how the human element in the industry can impact the overall security of a system. 
The question centrally revolves around how if technology exceeds a certain point, can this impact not only how Cyber Security tools will evolve, but also how the human element will be affected. Will it be easier for human elements to great exploits? Would the human element be removed entirely? 
I primarily ask this as I believe that at a certain point, processing for computers will grow so exponentially large, that hacking tools will become incredibly powerful unless rules and regulations are in place at some point. While I never had an initial problem statement that was passed through each stakeholder, the preformed questions I had prepared I then used to create my overall problem of the human element relating to exponentially processing speeds.

## SLO2 Apply design and systems thinking to respond to a defined or newly identified problem
During the first couple of weeks of the Summer Studio, I really lacked a sense of direction regarding how to utilise a design thinking approach towards work, more so towards any Cyber Security related problems. Due to how difficult it originally was, I didn’t necessarily adopt a design thinking approach initial since I had no proper understanding of what to do.
But towards the end of the studio when I started to use more difficult boxes and use my knowledge from practicing previous CTF machines. I managed to use a particular design thinking approach to understand how to handle this problem and what was expected. 
Once I started attempting CTF challenges like **Basic Pentesting**, **Literally Vulnerable** and the newer Hack-the-Box Machines **OpenAdmin** and **Traverxec** I was able to properly adopt a design thinking approach to each stage of the machine.
I follows a very similar process the three major E's, Enumerate, Exploit and Escalate. By using these "major E's" I was better able to utilise a design thinking methodology approach when attempting a box.
For example, if I were to attempt a box I would go through mostly the Define through to Testing.
<ol>
<li>
**Define** (The problem): Navigate through the machine to get Root.
</li>
<li>
**Ideate** (Create many ideas through brainstorming): Enumerate a systems files to find a possible lead.
</li>
<li>
**Prototype** (Hands-on approach): Finding an potential exploit.
</li>
<li>
**Test** (Testing solutions): Using a version exploit of Escalate user.
</li>
</ol>
This particular approach would repeat until the desired goal is meet.
Since I wouldn’t always find the correct exploit every time, I would have to repeat the Ideate process to determine a better solution.
This methodology approach to attempting boot-to-root challenges has better helped me in understaning how industry professionals attempt real world pentration testing scenarios. This same methodology can be applied to how hackers attack a system when attempting to breach a system, they would utilise the same **Define** to **Test** approach.

## SLO3 Apply technical skills to develop, model and/or evaluate designs
From the beginning of the studio I was already struggling with technical areas of Cyber Security, primarily skills used in CTF and Wargame challenges which I had some practice in but not enough to be confident in.
But over the six weeks, the studio has forced me to evolve and adapt my knowledge toward tools and concepts. Each week I learned a new concept that helped me on my Journey through the studio
<ul>
<li>
**Week 1** 
- *GitHub and GitBash*: Setting up this Hugo blog and website.
</li>
<li>
**Week 2** 
- *NetworkMapper(NMAP)/Zenmap and Linux CLI*: Used a lot of Linux CLI in OverTheWire / PicoCTP challenges and NMAP for presentation. 
</li>
<li>
**Week 3** 
- *Linux CLI, GIT, SQL Injection and Web Application based tools (Inspect element, Console, Network)*: Used a mixture of Linux CLI and Web Application attacks for OverTheWire-Natas challenges. SQL Injections was primarily used for our presentation but also used on OWASP Juice Shop (Demonstration can be found **<a href="https://www.hdrummon.me/post/reflection3/">**here.</a> ).
</li>
<li>
**Week 4**
- *WPScan, Dirb, Privilege Escalation, Netdiscover, Burp Suite, NetCat, Sudo Reverse Shell, Metasploit, John*: All of these were used when attempting **<a href="https://www.hdrummon.me/post/write-ups/basic-penetration-testing-1-write-up/">**Basic Pentesting</a>, **<a href="https://www.hdrummon.me/post/write-ups/me-and-my-girlfriend-write-up-1/">**Me and My Girlfriend 1</a> and **<a href="https://www.hdrummon.me/post/write-ups/literally-vulnerable/">**Literally Vulnerable.</a>   
</li>
<li>
**Week 5 and 6**
- *Dirb, Privilege Escalation, NetCat, Sudo Reverse Shell, John, Curl*: All of these were used in order to obtain both User and Root flags for the machines **<a href="https://www.hdrummon.me/post/write-ups/openadmin-write-up/">**OpenAdmin</a> and **<a href="https://www.hdrummon.me/post/write-ups/traverxec-write-up/">**Traverxec</a>.
</li>
</ul>
Over the studio, I have been exposed to new tools and techniques that help me when attempting challenges like those on Hack-the-Box. These tools are necessary in order to traverse through a system and obtain root. And consider my previously limited skills, which now I’ve refined further to now have confidence when attempting these new challenges. 
Previously I would never expect to have obtain root on any vulnerable machine, but to not only obtain a Hack-the-Box invite/ make an account but to also root 4 boxes.

## SLO4 Demonstrate effective collaboration and communication skills
During the studio especially in the earlier weeks, we were required to create and present a couple of topics that are related the cyber security field. It was an essential part of the studio as it not only allowed use to work in groups to build team and communication skills, but it also provided us the opportunity to further our knowledge in a particular area of the field.
It allowed us to properly collaborate regarding issues or progress we had during our deliverables and provided the opportunity to have a collective understanding of the topic. As mentioned, the major deliverables for weeks 2 and 3 were presentation based.
The two major presentations were:
<ul>
<li>
**Nmap** 
- *Myself, Dylan, Nik and Lachlan
</li>
<li>
**SQL Injection** 
- *Myself, Dowsen and Manish
</li>
</ul>
During both presentations, Facebook Messenger and Microsoft Teams were the main means of communication between each member. Though during the Week 2 presentation we opted to go with Trello to help manage our progress, which didn’t necessarily work out (This is further discussed in **<a href="https://www.hdrummon.me/post/reflection2/">**Reflection 2</a>)
But for later deliverables, while they were often individual I would use Discord to voice chat with other students to collaborate on certain issues that we had for that particular deliverable. And for the later showcase in Week 6, we would often meet up face-to-face to discuss it in real time.
## SLO5 Conduct critical self, peer, and group review and performance evaluation
The understanding of my own emotions has not only help better understand how to deal with them, but also has allowed me to have greater emotional intelligence to others as well in this studio.
Throughout this studio, I was able to better conduct my own self review through each reflection I did. This way I was able to not only document how I felt during the studio but also the progress Ive made up until now.
I would often find myself struggling to describe how I felt after certain events during the studio. It was often hard to document not only what I learned, but how I felt about it.
But as the studio progressed, I found it a lot more relaxed to document my emotions as I progress using a daily reflection process rather than a overall weekly reflection process. This way I was better able to document my own emotions while they were fresh and recently experienced compared to a weekly reflection that I would often struggle to remember how I felt.
<br>
<br>
Another way I was better able to review my performance was from the one-on-one feedback sessions that were available after most classes. This was an amazing opportunity understand if I was performing as expected and what I did correctly.
But it was also a great opportunity to highlight the negative feedback of what areas I need to improve or change in order to meet the required deliverable. This was extremely valued for me as it help motivate myself to do better to prevent such issues.
<br> 
I was introduced to Standups, which allowed every student to voice their strengths or progress, Weakness or struggles and there goals for the upcoming week. This was a great idea as it allowed us all to conduct our own review and performance evaluation of each other, so if anyone had a particular issue or weakness we could help them overcome it.
And often during meetings for our work, if anyone had issues we would discuss the issue weather that was through Microsoft Teams, Facebook Messenger, Discord or face-to-face. If it was relating to a Hack-the-Box challenge, we would try and give hints about their solution to try and encourage them to think a bit more while also not being too obvious about the answer.
<br>
<br>
I would also attempt to create small summary at the beginning of each reflection which would review how I felt during the whole week and what impact it had. These tied in with my **Issues** section which primarily focused on what problems I encounter during the week and if they were resolved or not. This would then be related to my goals for the next week as if it’s an issue I can resolve, id attempt to resolve it in the following week.

## Conclusion
Going into this studio I was really intimidated about how hard the content would be, and the obvious fear of failing because of it. Once I got settled into the studio and started understanding the content more, I slowly began to become a lot more confident in my evolving skills.
Coming in with very minor knowledge of cyber security concepts and lesser knowledge on pen testing and wargames, I was expecting the content to be brutal and never retain the knowledge taught. 
It provided the necessary resources to go from general understanding to having confidence in my knowledge.
<br>
<br>
The journey through the studio was both an insightful one and enjoyable, while providing its own challenges. The studio  encouraged me to better myself and refine my skills better in order to tackle the next challenge ahead. But to go from basic knowledge and understanding of CTFs to completing and rooting to Hack-the-Box machines is behind the expectation I set for myself.
The skills and knowledge I have gained can easily be applied to different machines and has also furthered my insight into my future career path. It has given me a better more clear picture as to what’s required as a cyber security specialist.
<br>
<br>
Not only has the studio provided me with the technical knowledge but it also has helped me refine my existing skills like communication, leadership, time management and problem solving. Without me even realizing it, the journey through the studio has provided me with greater experience in these areas and helped me properly refine my existing skills through feedback and results.
While there are still some goals that I didn't hit like completing one of the machines and spending more time refining my Hugo site, I do intend to complete these goals now even outside the studio. These goal represent my own commitment to my career like this portfolio which I can show with pride in the future to show the progress and journey I have made.
I can now say with confidence that this studio has increased my skills and knowledge to help me achieve my overall goal of becoming a Cyber Security Specialist.
