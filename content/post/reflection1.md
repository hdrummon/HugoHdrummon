<h3> Reflection 1 </h3>
<br>
This week was hard to produce a complete sprint due to my absence from class as I was overseas attending my grandfather funeral. This resulted in an increasingly difficult
week to understand what is required to be submitted. Luckily a fellow student, Dylan Tchan was able to fill me in with what was required for the sprint submission and how to set up 
this site.

<h4> Issues </h4>
I had some inital issues when preparing to create the website, such as installing the requires software like GIT since the laptop Im currently operating on is a Windows Surface X.
The issue was due to the new architecture that this new model used, preventing alot of software including some installers of git.
<br>
Other issues that occured was regarding the Netlify and NameCheap configuration.

Once I created the Name-Cheap domain and created the Netlify account, the issue was having the GIT Hub Repo point to Netlify and Netlify linked to NameCheap.
