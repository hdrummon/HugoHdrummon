<ol>
<li>Engage with stakeholders to identify a problem or scope a defined problem.</li>
<li>Apply design and systems thinking to respond to a defined or newly identified problem.</li>
<li>Apply technical skills to develop, model and/or evaluate designs.</li>
<li>Demonstrate effective collaboration and communication skills.</li>

</ol>
Regarding this weeks performances with the SLOs, due to my lack of attendence for the first classes, I was unable to make contact with any stakeholders or demonstrate collabrative/ communication skills, thus unable to complete SLO 1 and 4. I partially used SLO 2,3 and 5 throughout the development of this blog and setting up the repository, while at the end reflecting on the 
process of developing this sprint and how I achieved.

<h3> Reflection </h3>
<br>
This week was hard to produce a complete sprint due to my absence from class as I was overseas attending my grandfather funeral. This resulted in an increasingly difficult
week to understand what is required to be submitted. Luckily a fellow student, Dylan Tchan was able to fill me in with what was required for the sprint submission and how to set up 
this site.

<h3> Issues </h3>
I had some inital issues when preparing to create the website, such as installing the requires software like GIT since the laptop Im currently operating on is a Windows Surface X.
The issue was due to the new architecture that this new model used, preventing alot of software including some installers of git.
<br>
Other issues that occured was regarding the Netlify and NameCheap configuration.

Once I created the Name-Cheap domain and created the Netlify account, the issue was having the GIT Hub Repo point to Netlify and Netlify linked to NameCheap.
<br>
The only other significant issue was remembering the correct Git commands used to submit the files to Gitlab. By using <code> git init </code> , <code> git add .</code>, <code> git commit
-m "Comment for push" </code> and <code> git push origin master </code> codes I was able to deploy most of the files from my local computer.
