### Personal Reflection 4

## Monday 10/02
Again I was slightly late to the session due to my other subject **Career Management for IT Professionals Summer (31016)** having to do a 30 minute presentation for our final assignment. So I missed the stand-up meeting and the beginning of Jasons 
demonstration on the Wakanda box. While I was initally late, I still attempted to understand how the progress came up to this point by understanding what the overall goal was. From my understanding, it was to work your way from surface level information
and slowly make way to gain control of root. While some of the concepts im familiar with. It is the overall process and actually knowing what appropriate steps to take that I wish to understand.
We were then told what our next deliverable will be, that being a write-up of our own attempt at a penetrate a box challenge and documenting the process. In order to prepare for this deliverable, I have attempted the **Basic Pen-Testing 1** challenge in 
order to get familiar with the process necessary to work my way through it from the surface. I managed to complete it in class but plan on creating a Write-up and re attempting it tomorrow to refresh myself.

## Tuesday 11/02 Wednesday 12/02
Both Tuesday and Wednesday was spend mostly on doing Write-Ups and attempts on 2 machines. Primarily Basic Pen-Testing and Me and My Girlfriend machines. They were quite challenging considering it forced me into concepts im not familiar with
such as reverse shell and privlaage escalation. They are interesting concepts but have alot behind them but are vital for most boot-to-root exercises.
I did receive feedback regarding my Reflection 3 which required a couple more artefacts to support my sprint. This is mostly my own issue as I didnt atticapate that I would require more information to meet the requirements of the week. As a result I
plan on fleshing out my reflections in alot more depth while also remaining in the borders of what is required of me.
