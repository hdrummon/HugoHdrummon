### Personal Reflection 4

## Monday 10/02
Again I was slightly late to the session due to my other subject **Career Management for IT Professionals Summer (31016)** having to do a 30 minute presentation for our final assignment. So I missed the stand-up meeting and the beginning of Jasons 
demonstration on the Wakanda box. While I was initally late, I still attempted to understand how the progress came up to this point by understanding what the overall goal was. From my understanding, it was to work your way from surface level information
and slowly make way to gain control of root. While some of the concepts im familiar with. It is the overall process and actually knowing what appropriate steps to take that I wish to understand.
We were then told what our next deliverable will be, that being a write-up of our own attempt at a penetrate a box challenge and documenting the process. In order to prepare for this deliverable, I have attempted the **Basic Pen-Testing 1** challenge in 
order to get familiar with the process necessary to work my way through it from the surface. I managed to complete it in class but plan on creating a Write-up and re attempting it tomorrow to refresh myself.
