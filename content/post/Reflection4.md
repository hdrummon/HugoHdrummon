### Personal Reflection 4

## Monday 10/02
Again I was slightly late to the session due to my other subject **Career Management for IT Professionals Summer (31016)** having to do a 30 minute presentation for our final assignment. So I missed the stand-up meeting and the beginning of Jasons 
demonstration on the Wakanda box. While I was initially late, I still attempted to understand how the progress came up to this point by understanding what the overall goal was. From my understanding, it was to work your way from surface level information
and slowly make way to gain control of root. While some of the concepts I’m familiar with. It is the overall process and actually knowing what appropriate steps to take that I wish to understand.
We were then told what our next deliverable will be, that being a write-up of our own attempt at a penetrate a box challenge and documenting the process. In order to prepare for this deliverable, I have attempted the **Basic Pen-Testing 1** challenge in 
order to get familiar with the process necessary to work my way through it from the surface. I managed to complete it in class but plan on creating a Write-up and re attempting it tomorrow to refresh myself.

## Tuesday 11/02 Wednesday 12/02
Both Tuesday and Wednesday was spend mostly on doing Write-Ups and attempts on 2 machines. Primarily <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/"> Basic Pen-Testing</a> and <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/"> Me and My Girlfriend</a> machines. They were quite challenging considering it forced me into concepts I’m not familiar with
such as reverse shell and privilege escalation. They are interesting concepts but have a lot behind them but are vital for most boot-to-root exercises.
I did receive feedback regarding my Reflection 3 which required a couple more artefacts to support my sprint. This is mostly my own issue as I didn’t anticipate that I would require more information to meet the requirements of the week. As a result I
plan on fleshing out my reflections in a lot more depth while also remaining in the borders of what is required of me.

## Thursday 13/02
Today was primarily focused on boot-to-root challenges and Selecting our box that we need to hack for our submission. Since the Me and My Girlfriend box was done by another student, I decided to find a slightly more challenging box to do.
The box selected was Literally-Vulnerability box, which has 3 flags within the machine (local.txt, user.txt, root.txt). Before Jason did a demonstration of a boot-to-root we did another stand up regarding out strengths and weaknesses.
I primarily focused on my slow but steady adaptation to the process of analysing a machine and penetrate it. As for weaknesses its mostly being able to recognize the vulnerabilities a machine has and the steps to exploit it. I hope to solve this by just continuing to
get to root on different challenges.
I then did a 1-on-1 feedback regarding my Reflection 3, and what changes I need to submit it as a pass. The primary changes needed are just having artefacts for team collaboration and providing evidence on my technical knowledge of SQL Injections. 
Aside from that I received feedback about my presentation which was apparently good overall. Once I knew what changes i needed for my reflection 3, I’ve made the changes and posted some screenshots supporting these statements.
For the rest of the day I spend on creating a section on my portfolio for Write-Ups and for my submission this Sunday.

## Friday 14/02 Sunday 16/02
The last couple of days of the week were primarily focused on boot-to-root with my selected box being **Literally-Vulnerability**. This was quite a challenging box compared to **Basic Pen-Testing1** and ** Me and My Girlfriend1**.
There was a major error that prevented me from continuing the box which in turn halted my writeup for the box. I was left seriously frustrated with how this may impact me and the disatisfaction of not being able to completely attempt the box.
I even contacted Jason about this issue and Nik who is also doing the same box as me. Nik also had the same issue and the suggestions that Jason made didnt work as it continued to error. I was also preparing for a presentation with Dylan for our other subject,
**Career Management for IT Professionals Summer (31016)**. This really tested my managment skills having to manage both preparing with my team for that presenation and conducting my write-up / trouble shooting my **WPScan** issue.
