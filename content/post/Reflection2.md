### Personal Reflection 2
After finally being settled back in the first week a lot more has happening in terms of progress. This sprint was a lot more eventful then last week, due to more interaction with stakeholders in the field and discussion of the industry, as well as exploring into element surrounding them. Overall this sprint was productive and eventful in the right ways.
## Tuesday 28/01
The Tuesday class had two speakers come in and deliver a presentation on particular areas of the field, Patrick Kelso and Robert Mitchell.  Patrick's presentation of interesting aspects of Linux such as **tmux** and **I3** window manager. The tools shown seem quite interesting, but I would need time to further investigate how these tools work and how I would ever used them, as they initially are really intimating to me, given the technical understanding required to use them. Another interesting topic I asked Patrick about was his version of Linux he was running as I was quite interested from its general UX aesthetic. This was actually **Manjaro,** a distribution based on Arch Linux. In future I plan on following the same direction as Patrick and running Manjaro on a dedicated computer to not only help my Linux understanding through refinement and constant use, but future use in the industry. 
After the presentation I spoke with Patrick individually and discussed the issue regarding entering to a Cyber Security job with no industry experience. This problem is close to me since I'm really driven to find a job and have a career in the cyber security field, but find it harder now to find opportunities to do so.
This is seriously frustrating to me since all advertisements focus on graduate roles and 3+ years of work experience in the industry. Patrick's advice regarding the situation was simply networking with people in the industry who may have opportunities. This would involve meeting others who work in the industry at events, meetups, societies and online forums.

With Robert Mitchell's talk I was a lot more intrigued since he talked primarily about the elements around hackers and attributes associated with attacks and system. 
I was genuinely interested in this presentation as it tackled these concepts that are still prominent in modern society, but also presented real world examples from an industry professional. 
This helped me further understand how cybersecurity is important from the exams that Robert presented, from early attacks such as "**ILOVEYOU"** and "**Melissa"** to more modern attack methods such as ransomware to **"Mirai"** botnet, an attack that incorporated several IOT cameras used in a botnet for attacks.
I found this quite frightening yet also interesting as it both presents how early attacks still use similar elements to modern attacks, and how easily people can reverse engineer simple innocent cameras and devices that run Linux and use them in an attack.
I then asked a question to Robert that ive thought about for a while "Is there a point were processing power hits a threshold that cyber security tools wont handle" that being that attackers could easily penetrate systems due to how quickly it can process data and algorithms. Roberts presents that it wouldn't have a major impact if the processing power was to increase overtime, as cyber security tools would equally increase as hacker tools would. As I see much later, tools in cyber security tends to have a double edge to them, being used for both security and attacking purposes.
Once the presentations were complete, we begin forming teams for a presentation due Thursday, which is to present a resonance tool used in the cyber security field. Immediately we chose **NMAP,** a network mapping tool that helps scan for open ports on a network and gather information on the system scanned. I was quiet complacent to use **NMAP** as I've had prior experience with it through the subject **Cybersecurity 48730**.
## Wednesday 29/01
Today was primarily focused on gathering information and preparing for the presentation. I meet up with Dylan Tchan in Building 2 to prepare for the presentation and start preparing for each of our relevant sections. We prepared before hand by setting up a **Trello** group and splitting up the tasks between the four of us, Dylan, Nicholas, Lachlan and myself

For my section, I primarily focused on looking into industry impact of **NMAP** and providing a demonstration on how it operates. As I observed with Roberts presentation, **NMAP** can be used both as a tool for helping Cyber Security Specialists patch potential exploits that an attack can use, but at the same time an attacker can use **NMAP** or **ZENMAP** (GUI version of NMAP) to find exploits they can use such as open ports and version exploits. So this section I was pretty complacent to do relative to the other sections in the presentation. Overall I was quite happy with how the progress was made in the session. I was quite happy of how Dylan made the presentation and how my demo was made.

## Thursday 30/01

We presented our **NMAP** slideshow but was unfortunately cut off due to time constraints. This was primarily caused by Lachlan's section taking up a bulk of the time causing the following sections to be rushed but even still cut off. I felt quite frustrated about this as my section was at the end with the demo and was unable to show the demo that I had to organize the previous day. The frustration was partly due to the back and forth messaging with Jason about the appropriate demo if it should be a recording or screenshots. 

The rest of the day was spent on hacking challenges such as **OverTheWire-Bandit** and **PicoCTP** then making write-ups for each of the tasks. This was a good opportunity to refine my write-up skills as I don't tend to explain or document what I do and rather just remember it, which tends to work against me. So I've made initial write up of just basic steps for each challenge and will later revisit the challenges to work on in-depth write ups.

I also engaged in feedback with my first sprint submission last Monday 27th. I was quite disappointed with my submission as I could have easily worked on it more but due to my absence and lack of knowledge, I was unable to really flesh out my website and reflection. But based on the feedback that Larry and Jason gave me, I apparently did ok. While this may seem like a great thing I know I can do better and despite the circumstances I was in, with more drive I could do better.

## Issues

There were a couple of issues that cropped up across the weak, all with varying degree of effect. Some of these were resolved but some are long occurring issues that would need to be addressed in later sprints.

- For the **NMAP** presentation, I was planning on scanning [www.uts.edu.au] **NMAP** operates. As I asked Jason hoping to be able to demonstrate this I was unable to due to policies. I did have screenshots from **Cyber Security 48730** that I was going to use in the presentation, and a video demonstration of a scan on another virtual machine connected.

- A large issue was around the organization around the presentation between the team using **Trello**. We primarily communicated on **Microsoft Teams**, so by using **Trello** for a simple 2 day presentation wasn't much needed. While for larger group tasks it would be much more appropriate being able to monitor and divide tasks easily.

## Goals/ To-do list

- Do reflections each day to save time rather then on a single day.
- Try to do more wargames and improve write ups.
- Improve time management techniques.
- Improve team management and communication.
- Improve and make changes to website (background / presentatio)
