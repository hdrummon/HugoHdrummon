# Reflection 6#
The last week of Summer Studio was quite eventful. I managed to obtain both user and root for the Traverxec box and presented our showcase of the OpenAdmin box. It was also a major week to reflect on all the work that has lead up to this showcase since in our presentation we talked about how what we learned over the six weeks has helped us obtain root in OpenAdmin
I was quite surprised at how easily I was able to get to root from the Traverxec box, but just feel uneasy about it since I didn’t expect my skills and knowledge to be applied that quickly. But I’m overall excited that I managed to complete it so soon
As the final concluding week of the Summer Studio, it has been a fun and worthwhile experience to have while also forwarding my knowledge of cybersecurity and better prepared me for the future ahead.

## Monday 24/02

Today was the last day in the class that we had time to discuss our major deliverable, which was another completed machine from Hack the Box, but needing to get both keys user and root.txt.
This was also the time to start organizing our presentation/ showcase for the summer studio.
Within my team, Nik, Dylan, Tyrone and myself, we decided to use OpenAdmin for our showcase, since it shows everything we learned throughout the studio, from learning in Wargames and CTFS to using resonance and web application exploit tools.

I managed to also complete and root the Traverxec box for my final submission. 
Ill be focusing on creating a writeup tomorrow since I only managed to get root in the later hours before midnight. 
While I was quite happy to get root I needed to have a refreshed mind to make the write-up the following day.

Overall the machine was quite similar to my previous machine OpenAdmin. 
They both shared similar enumeration processes and configuration files to help me further determine exploits. 
There were still sections that I was stuck on, but I mostly focused on using google to help determine the right path rather than trying rabbit holes.

## Tuesday 25/02  Wednesday 26/02

The group and myself meet up at uni to organize the presentation and allocate roles as to who will be presenting certain sections for the showcase. 
Through discussing in person and through messenger we delegated roles and organized the overall pace of how and what we would present with the showcase

I also focused on finishing the write-up for Traverxec so I can mostly focus on organizing a demo of Openadmin. 
I had a couple of issues during the recording that require a reshoot of the demo, but a major issue happened during the SSH process later in the machine which made me skip over the section to redo it later due to a connection issue between my Openvpn and the Hack-the-Box network. 
I then had Dylan edit the demo for the showcase, which I mostly focused on having him edit the section were the error occurred. 
The video for the demo can be found on my Write-up **<a href="https://www.hdrummon.me/post/write-ups/openadmin-write-up/">**here.</a> 

## Thursday 27/02

Today was the main showcase day of our final presentation of OpenAdmin. It was an overall quiet showcase with only 2 people coming to our stall to look at our presentation. 
We initially discussed what we did in the weeks of the studio and how they leads to our final deliverable. I mostly discuss the key deliverables for each week and what the main focus of them was, then how those skills helped us with our deliverable for the showcase.
Once I discussed the main focuses of each week, we provided some background context as to what was the methodology we used when attempting OpenAdmin, in this case we talked about the three major E's: Enumeration, Exploitation and Escalation.
This section primarily was in relation to how we progressed through OpenAdmin, but it was also the main process we learned throughout the studio, which was most prominent in the late weeks since we were tackling more harder machines.

I then discussed how a scenario such as OpenAdmin could affect the industry. From normal users and business to the politics and reputation behind the attack.
We then split the two up so we could showcase the demonstration of OpenAdmin to the 2 visitors. 
One of which was a Professor in the Engineering Faculty, I was quite intermediated when presenting, since he was already quite familiar with how UNIX systems operate. 
But after the presentation we had a chance to have a one-on-one conversation about the cyber security subjects here at UTS and how they should change.

I discussed with him mostly about how initially understanding the concepts of cyber security are overwhelming since previous subjects like Cryptography (Formally Security Fundamentals) and Cyber Security lacked any real explanation to real world examples or context, and mostly focused on poorly formatted theory work. 
He then asked how we were able to understand these concepts within the 6 weeks compared to a regular 12-13 week subject. 
I then explained that we were initially thrown into the deep end of it but were guided with the help of online resources like Hacksplaining and PicoCTF to help refine our understanding of these new concepts as well as real world stakeholders that have proper industry experience coming into the studio too provide insight into the cybersecurity mindset.

Since I knew he was helping create some of the new cybersecurity related subjects, I wanted to try emphasizing the need to have passion driven knowledge and relation to practical and theory based content rather than having no correlation between content like those previous subjects. 
Again I made reference to how I initially had very limited knowledge about particular areas in the cybersecurity area, and never being able to get into hack the box, to now having a proper understanding and resources required as well as now completing two machines on Hack the Box.

Overall, despite the showcase being very quiet for people, it was a good time to refine my presentation skills and having one-on-one conversation regarding these important topics. 
Sadly Tyrone was unable to make it but it was for the best since we as a team didn't want him to spread his flu or perform under that condition.

## Issues
This week I had only a minor issue regarding the recording of the OpenAdmin. This was due to the connection between my Openvpn and the Hack-the-Box which caused errors when I was executing commands during the recording which I had to cut from the final presentation.
Which I had Dylan edit the two clips I recorded to navigate around this issue. Thanks to Dylan’s editing skills it was resolved quite easily. Apart from this issue, the only other issue would be the lack of engagement we had with visitors. While we still had two visitors, it would have been better if more would have interacted with us to help refine our presentation and one-on-one communication.

## Goals/ To-do
Since this is the last reflection for the studio I still have some overall goals that I would still like to complete in time:
- Further research into HackSplaining and PicoCTF
- Attempt more Hack-the-Box machines
- Improve time management techniques
- Improve and make changes to website (background / presentation).
- Finish **Literally-Vulnerability** box.
