### Personal Reflection 3

## Monday 3/02
I arrived slightly late to class due to my other subject **Career Management for IT Professionals Summer (31016)** having mock interviews to prepare us for future application process.
It began with our stand-up meeting instructed to express our strengths and weaknesses from last week and how we intend to improve and manage out weaknesses. I primarily focused on my time with **Linux CLI** as its always been an area that I closely intend to improve, and by constantly using **Linux CLI** in CTF challenges, I intend to further improve my Linux skills. 
This then leads into a big weakness of mine is further understanding **GIT** and **Hugo** as recently I've had trouble deploying some of the edits for my Reflection2. 
This was primarily due to me forgetting to create the post initially and then coping my text over from notion. This cause a couple of errors and formatting issue but with further research into **Shortcodes** and **Hugo** formatting and proper procedure I should be able to resolve this issue in time.

After the stand-up we proceeded to talk about our next deliverable, Web Application attack/exploit. So for this deliverable we are researching **SQL Injection**, what it is, how it works and its impact on the industry and what can be done to mitigate it.
My section is primarily focusing on how it works and providing a demo of **SQL Injection** and the logic behind it. This for me is a good opportunity to tackle a problem I've had for a while which is primarily understanding how it actually works, how I will encounter it and most important for me, how to use it for bounties and challenges. 
This stems back to when I first joined the Cyber-Security Society and experiences challenges that involved **SQL Injections**. This will be a great opportunity to finally understand it in greater depth. 
My primary focus for this presentation is providing a demo showing some of the more challenging and insightful elements of SQL Injection.

## Tuesday 4/02 - Wednesday 5/02
Tuesday and Wednesday I was focused more on find a good example of an **SQL Injection** before the presentation, but then soon side tracked and attempted more OverTheWire. I moved from Bandit to Natas which focused a lot more on web vulnerabilities and exploits. 
I wasn't able to get far only getting to Natas 4 and I plan on redoing them with a proper write-ups later.

I managed to record a demo of an **SQL Injection** from Herokuapp, but I'm still in search of a more complex **SQL Injection** to show how complex and lethal they can be. 
I'm happy with how the demo turned out and I'm continuing to research how **SQL Injections** operate.

Towards the end making the final preparations for the presentation on Canva, I didnt end up finding an appropriate more complex example. But this ended up working well since when practicing
the timing of the presentation we were slightly over the 6 minute mark. So even if I was to include a more complex demo, it would have taken up too much time on the presentation. I managed to write up and practice my script
for the presentation and made the final changes for the presentation ready for tomorrow.


## Thursday 6/02
We presented our **SQL Injection** slideshow and was still cut off but not as close as I expected and actually managed to show off my demo this time. I was quite pleased how it turned out but during
my section I started losing my thoughts thinking that I started repeating my points during my presentation. This if future I will need to address and have more practice on my presentation and
ensuring I follow my script and guidelines. 

The rest of the day was spent on OverTheWire Natas challenges which I already previously participated in but mostly focused on create write-ups. Dylan Tchan and myself create a collaboration document to share our write-ups for future reference.

## Issues
This week didnt have any major issues apart from the difficulty finding an appropriate demo for the presentation. The only other major issue would be procrastion by either attempting more OverTheWire
or getting side tracked with my **Career Management for IT Professionals Summer (31016)** Assignment. Im still improving on communication with my team members and better improving time management.

## Goals/ To-do list
- ~~Do reflections each day to save time rather then on a single day.~~
- Try to do more wargames and improve write ups.
- Improve time management techniques.
- Improve team management and communication.
- Improve and make changes to website (background / presentation)
- Learn more about Git and Hugo to better edit my site.
