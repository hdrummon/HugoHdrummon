### Personal Reflection 3

## Monday 3/02
I arrived slightly late to class due to my other subject **Career Management for IT Professionals Summer (31016)** having mock interviews to prepare us for future application process.
It began with our stand-up meeting instructed to express our strengths and weaknesses from last week and how we intend to improve and manage out weaknesses. I primarily focused on my time with **Linux CLI** as its always been an area that I closely intend to improve, and by constantly using **Linux CLI** in CTF challenges, I intend to further improve my Linux skills. 
This then leads into a big weakness of mine is further understanding **GIT** and **Hugo** as recently I've had trouble deploying some of the edits for my Reflection2. 
This was primarily due to me forgetting to create the post initially and then coping my text over from notion. This cause a couple of errors and formatting issue but with further research into **Shortcodes** and **Hugo** formatting and proper procedure I should be able to resolve this issue in time.

After the stand-up we proceeded to talk about our next deliverable, Web Application attack/exploit. So for this deliverable we are researching SQL Injection, what it is, how it works and its impact on the industry and what can be done to mitigate it.â€‹
My section is primarily focusing on how it works and providing a demo of SQL Injection and the logic behind it. This for me is a good opportunity to tackle a problem I've had for a while which is primarily understanding how it actually works, how I will encounter it and most important for me, how to use it for bounties and challenges. 
This stems back to when I first joined the Cyber-Security Society and experiences challenges that involved SQL Injections. This will be a great opportunity to finally understand it in greater depth. 
My primary focus for this presentation is providing a demo showing some of the more challenging and insightful elements of SQL Injection.
